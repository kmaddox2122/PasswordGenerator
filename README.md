#### Main Take-away: Updated codebase in order to write JavaScript to create a random password generator.

### Goals for this project:
    -Add functionality via JavaScript to a password generator.
    -Offer certain criteria for users to choose for their password.
    -Generate a passwork based on chosen criteria.

### What I did:
    -Added a prompt window to ask the number of characters once the "generate password" button has been pressed.
    -Added a second promp window to ask if any lowercase letters should be used.

### What I plan to do:
    -Complete prompt windows to gain further criteria.
    -Generate a password based on entered criteria.
    -Populate generated password in an alert.

### What I learned:
    During the course of this challenge, I not only gained a better knowledge of how JavaScript works, but also gained a better understanding of the syntax.
